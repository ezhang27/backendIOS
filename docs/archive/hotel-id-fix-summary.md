# Hotel ID and API Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Hotel IDs Issue

We discovered two instances of "Inn at Hastings Park" hotel in the database with different IDs:
- ID 1: `2f9c8b7a-6d5e-4f3e-2d1c-0b9a8c7d6e5f` (deleted)
- ID 2: `2f9c8b7a-e7a0-4c70-9d35-add5e67a8c7d` (kept)

This duplication was causing confusion and potential data inconsistencies.

### 2. Missing Validation Module

The server was failing to start due to a missing validation module which was required by various API endpoints.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Hotel ID Consolidation

We created and executed a script (`scripts/mergeHotelIds.ts`) to:
- Identify all tables with references to the hotel IDs
- Move all data from the older hotel ID to the newer one
- Delete the older hotel record after resolving all foreign key references

All of the following tables were updated to use the single hotel ID:
- announcement
- message
- guest
- employee
- price
- restaurant
- reservation
- room
- building
- facility
- menuitem
- request
- guestfeedback
- guestpreference
- feedbackcategory
- feedbackrating

In total, we migrated 113 records to the consolidated hotel ID.

### 2. Added Validation Module

We created the missing `src/common/validation.ts` module that provides:
- Generic validation functions
- Common validation schemas
- Hotel ID validation helpers

## Verification

We verified our fixes by:
1. Running `scripts/checkHotelData.ts` to confirm only one hotel ID exists
2. Starting the server and successfully connecting to it
3. Testing the API endpoint with the correct hotel ID:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X GET -H "X-Hotel-ID: 2f9c8b7a-e7a0-4c70-9d35-add5e67a8c7d" "http://localhost:3000/api/guest/messages/announcements"
   ```
4. Confirming that all 6 announcements for the hotel are returned correctly

## Future Recommendations

1. **Enforce Hotel ID Consistency**: Use the single hotel ID (`2f9c8b7a-e7a0-4c70-9d35-add5e67a8c7d`) for all future "Inn at Hastings Park" operations.
2. **Update Documentation**: Ensure all API documentation and tests use the correct hotel ID.
3. **Database Constraints**: Consider adding unique constraints on hotel names to prevent future duplications.
4. **ID Reference Management**: Implement a centralized hotel ID management system to prevent hardcoded IDs across different files.
