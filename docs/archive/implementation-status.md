- âœ… Hotel data endpoints
  - Get hotel details
  - List/view rooms
  - List/view restaurants and menus
  - List/view facilities
  - List/view events

### Management API
- âœ… Base endpoint (`/api/management`)
- âœ… Basic management request handling
  - List all requests for a hotel (with filtering and pagination)
  - Get details of a specific request
  - Update request status (including marking as completed)
- âœ… Hotel data management
  - Update hotel information
  - CRUD operations for rooms
  - CRUD operations for restaurants and menus
  - CRUD operations for facilities
  - CRUD operations for events

## Database Integration
- âœ… PostgreSQL database connection
- âœ… Drizzle ORM integration
- âœ… Database schema defined in `src/models/schema.ts`
- âœ… Seed script to populate test data

## API Features
- âœ… Error handling middleware
- âœ… Input validation
- âœ… Response formatting
- âœ… Simple filtering (by status, pagination)
- âœ… Basic search capability in management API
- âœ… Comprehensive API documentation
- âœ… Testing guides with example data

## Pending Implementation

### Authentication
- ðŸ“… Clerk integration for guest authentication
- ðŸ“… Clerk integration for staff/management authentication
- ðŸ“… Role-based authorization for management API
- ðŸ“… JWT validation and session management

### Guest API Extensions
- ðŸ“… Guest profiles and preferences
- ðŸ“… Reservation management
- ðŸ“… Dining and room service orders
- ðŸ“… Feedback and ratings

### Management API Extensions
- ðŸ“… Staff assignment to requests
- ðŸ“… Request comments and internal notes
- ðŸ“… Dashboard statistics and metrics
- ðŸ“… Guest management features
- ðŸ“… Inventory management
- ðŸ“… Reporting capabilities

### Infrastructure
- ðŸ“… Logging system
- ðŸ“… Monitoring and alerting
- ðŸ“… CI/CD pipeline improvements
- ðŸ“… Comprehensive testing suite

## Next Implementation Steps

Based on current progress, these are the recommended next steps:

1. **Complete authentication integration**
   - Implement Clerk authentication for both guest and management APIs
   - Replace query parameter authentication with JWT token validation
   - Add authorization middleware for role-based access control

2. **Enhance the management dashboard APIs**
   - Add staff assignment functionality to requests
   - Implement request notes/comments for staff communication
   - Develop dashboard statistics endpoints

3. **Expand guest services**
   - Implement dining and room service order functionality
   - Add reservation management features
   - Develop guest preferences and personalization

## Technical Constraints

The current implementation has the following constraints:

- The database schema is fixed and cannot be modified at this time
- Any new features must work within the existing database structure
- Authentication is simplified for development purposes, using query parameters instead of JWT tokens
- API testing documentation should be maintained and updated with each new feature
